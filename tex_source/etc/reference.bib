    abstract = "{Seismological models of the outer core’s radial velocity structure show that the outermost core is slower than PREM. For models derived from body-wave data these low velocities are confined to the top of the outer core, while normal-mode data prefer a velocity gradient that deviates from PREM throughout the entire outer core. These different models have led to conflicting interpretations regarding the presence of stratification at the top of the outer core. While body-wave based models have been shown to require a compositionally stratified outermost core, the velocity and density profiles obtained from normal-mode data correspond to a homogeneous outer core. In addition, the observed low velocities in the outermost core are difficult to reconcile with compositional models of stratification, as the required enrichment in light elements would generally increase seismic velocities. Here, we investigate how well-suited both seismic body-wave and normal-mode data are to constrain the velocity and density structure of the outer core. To this end, we model and compare the effects of outer-core structure and D″ structure on the differential traveltimes of body-wave phases SmKS and on the centre frequencies of normal modes. We find that a trade-off between outer-core structure and D″ structure exists for both data types, but neither data can be readily explained by reasonable D″ velocities and densities. Low outermost-core velocities are therefore still required by seismological data. Using additional information from the centre frequencies of Stoneley modes—normal modes that are particularly sensitive to variations in velocity and density at the top of the outer core—we confirm that normal-mode data indeed require low velocities with respect to PREM in the outermost core, similar to a recent normal-mode model, and an overall higher outer-core density. The presence of buoyant stratification in the outermost core is therefore not immediately supported by the centre frequencies of Stoneley modes. Stratification with high seismic velocity, as one would expect from most straightforward stratification-forming processes, is directly contradicted by our results.}",

For earthquakes recorded by broadband seismometer networks in the world, we measure differential travel times between S3KS and S2KS, between S4KS and S3KS, and between S5KS and S3KS by array techniques. The differential times are well fit by a Vp model of the Earth’s outermost core, KHOMC (Kaneshima and Helffrich, 2013). Differential slownesses of S4KS and S2KS relative to S2KS are also measured for the highest quality data. The measured slownesses, with unique sensitivity to the outer core 200\UTF{2013}400km below the CMB, are matched by KHOMC. These observations consolidate the evidence for the presence at the top of the outer core of a layer that has a distinctively steeper Vp gradient than the bulk of the outer core. We invert new SmKS differential time data set by a tau-p method and attempt to refine the Vp profile of KHOMC. The essential features of KHOMC are preserved after the model refinement. However, the newly estimated layer thickness is nearly 450km, which is thicker than that of KHOMC. The Vp anomalies relative to PREM for the depths 400\UTF{2013}800km below the CMB are less than 0.03km/s, consistent with the degree of agreement between different Vp models for the depth range."

Earlier studies revealed the Sun's surface rotation, but now a detailed observational picture has been built up of the internal rotation of our nearest star. Unlike the predictions of stellar-evolution models, the radiative interior is found to rotate roughly uniformly. The rotation within the convection zone is also very different from prior expectations, which had been that the rotation rate would depend primarily on the distance from the rotation axis. Layers of rotational shear have been discovered at the base of the convection zone and in the subphotospheric layers. Studies of the time variation of rotation have uncovered zonal-flow bands, extending through a substantial fraction of the convection zone, which migrate over the course of the solar cycle, and there are hints of other temporal variations and of a jet-like structure. At the same time, building on earlier work with mean-field models, researchers have made great progress in supercomputer simulations of the intricate interplay between turbulent convection and rotation in the Sun's interior. Such studies are beginning to transform our understanding of how rotation organizes itself in a stellar interior. }

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Below the convection zone, where the stratification is radiatively controlled, large-scale motions should be mainly horizontal, i.e., in spherical shells due to the stabilizing effect of negative buoyancy on radial displacements. Watson showed that the observed surface solar differential rotation is at the threshold for instability to horizontal disturbances. Therefore, since helioseismology tells us the latitudinal differential rotation below the convection zone is less than the surface value, the profile should be stable too. We show that in the presence of a broad, nonuniform toroidal field the solar differential rotation is unstable. This is true for a wide range of kinetic and magnetic energies of the unperturbed state, from well below equipartition to well above it. We find instability for essentially all values of differential rotation and toroidal fields for which we are able to find converged solutions. The instability appears to occur only for longitudinal wave number 1. Disturbance symmetries about the equator and profiles in latitude depend on the amplitude of the toridal field. Peak e-folding times are a few months. The primary energy source for the instability is differential rotation for low field strengths and the toroidal field for high field strengths. The mechanism of energy release from the differential rotation is the poleward transport of angular momentum, by the Maxwell stress rather than the Reynolds stress. For the profiles studied, the Reynolds stress is almost always trying to rebuild differential rotation, the exact opposite of the nonmagnetic case. Second-order perturbation theory predicts that the unstable modes produce zonal jets and fine structure in the toroidal field, the latitude of which migrates toward the equator with increasing magnetic field strength. The instability we have found may play a role in the solar dynamo, although being two-dimensional, it cannot produce a dynamo by itself. Mixing of angular momentum caused by the instability could allow achievement of equilibrium of the solar tachocline hypothesized by Spiegel & Zahn.}

	title = {Joint Instability of Latitudinal Differential Rotation and Toroidal Magnetic Fields below the Solar Convection Zone. {II}. Instability for Toroidal Fields that Have a Node between the Equator and Pole},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We generalize results of Gilman and Fox to unperturbed toroidal fields that have a node somewhere between the equator and the pole as we speculate the Sun's field to have for most phases of its magnetic cycle. We use the same solution method as in Gilman and Fox, namely Legendre polynomial expansion and matrix inversion to solve for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The solutions are structured around certain singular or critical points of the suitably transformed and combined vorticity and induction equations. There are singular points at the poles, and singularities where ω0-cr=±α0, in which ω0 is the local rotation rate, cr is the longitudinal phase speed of an unstable wave, and α0 is an angular measure of the toroidal field. We survey the instability as a function of toroidal field profile and amplitude as well as differential rotation amplitude, thereby examining reference states that could be characteristic of most phases of the solar cycle, and most depths within the rotational shear layer just below the base of the solar convection zone.
As found in Gilman and Fox, instability occurs for a wide range of both toroidal fields and differential rotations. Differential rotation is again the primary energy source for growing modes when the toroidal field is weak, and the toroidal field is the primary source when it is strong. Unlike in Gilman and Fox, here modes of both symmetries about the equator are unstable for low and high toroidal fields, and for high fields a second antisymmetric mode appears. Which mode symmetry is favored for low fields depends in detail on the relative amplitudes of differential rotation and toroidal field. For low toroidal fields (unstable) modes of both symmetries are energetically active (extracting energy from the unperturbed state) only poleward of the node and an adjacent singularity, but are coupled to energetically neutral velocity perturbations equatorward of that singular point. In transition to higher field strengths, those velocity patterns are damped out when two additional singular points appear in the system, but the energetically active high-latitude disturbances remain. By contrast the second antisymmetric mode is energetically active equatorward of the toroidal field node and closely adjacent singular points, but is coupled to an energetically neutral pattern of both velocities and magnetic fields on the poleward side.
As in Gilman and Fox, we find narrow-latitude bands of sharp changes in both differential rotation and toroidal magnetic field that migrate toward the equator with increasing field strength, but are bounded in their migration by the latitude of the toroidal field node. These sharp changes are always at the locations of the singular points of the system and represent narrow domains where both kinetic and magnetic energy are being extracted from the reference state to drive the instability.
We interpret the instability as a form of resonant overreflection between singular points, analogous to what happens in stratified shear flow, as described for example by Lindzen. The instability may contribute to determining the latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of active regions and other large-scale, magnetic features on the Sun, as well as enable a degree of synchronization of the evolution of the solar cycle between low latitudes and high, and between north and south hemispheres.}

Solutions are found for a wide range of differential rotation amplitudes found in the solar tachocline, for toroidal fields that have a node that ranges in latitude from the pole to the equator, as we expect to exist in the Sun through a sunspot cycle. Fixed ER is a proxy for nonlinear saturation of the solar dynamo due to the reaction of electromagnetic body forces. Since the saturation ratio is not known from either theory or observations, we find solutions in the range 0.1 \UTF{2264} ER \UTF{2264} 30, corresponding to peak toroidal fields in the solar tachocline of between about 8 × 103 to 1.4 × 105 G. We focus on properties of the unstable disturbances that could test the hypothesis that such disturbances in the solar tachocline provide a template for surface features. We show that the symmetry of magnetic pattern about the equator could switch at one or more phases of the magnetic cycle, and for high ER a switch could also occur between two antisymmetric patterns of different latitudinal profiles. In the former case, the pattern rotation rate would be unchanged, but there would be a sudden longitudinal phase shift in one or both hemispheres. In the latter case, there would be no phase shift but instead a substantial change in the rotation rate of the observed magnetic pattern. For a given mode symmetry and type, the rotation rate is the same at all latitudes, with the rate being close to that of the local rotation of the plasma at the latitude where the disturbance amplitude peaks. For ER \UTF{2272} 1, the disturbance magnetic patterns have significant tilts upstream away from the equator, reminiscent of similar patterns in synoptic magnetograms. Sharp changes with latitude in the differential rotation and toroidal field are associated with "critical points" in the system, where the Doppler-shifted disturbance rotation equals the local (angular) Alfv\UTF{00E9}n speed. These migrate toward the equator with the toroidal field node but increasingly lag it. The higher the magnetic energy for a given differential rotation, the closer the equator is approached. If these sharp changes in differential rotation and toroidal field are related to the torsional oscillations and latitudes of sunspots, then these solutions favor large toroidal fields in the tachocline, of peak amplitude at least 6 × 104 G.}

	abstract = {Motivated by observations of sunspot and active-region latitudes that suggest that the subsurface toroidal field in the Sun occurs in narrow latitude belts, we analyze the joint instability of solar latitudinal differential rotation and the concentrated toroidal field below the base of the convection zone, extending the work of Gilman & Fox (hereafter GF). We represent the profile of the toroidal field by Gaussian functions whose width is a variable parameter and solve the two-dimensional perturbation equations of GF by relaxation methods. We reproduce the results of GF for broad profiles, and we find instability for a wide range of amplitudes of differential rotation and toroidal fields (103-106 G fields at the base of the solar convection zone), as well as a wide range of toroidal-field bandwidths. We show that the combination of concentrated toroidal fields and solar-type latitudinal differential rotation is again unstable, not only to longitudinal wavenumber m=1 as in GF, but also to m>1 for sufficiently narrow toroidal-field profiles. For a fixed peak field strength, the growth rate first increases as the toroidal-field band is narrowed, reaching a peak for bandwidths between 10° and 20° in latitude, depending on the peak field strength, and then decreases to a cut-off in the instability for toroidal field bands of 3°-4°. Irrespective of bandwidth, the differential rotation is the primary energy source for the instability for weak fields, and the toroidal field is the primary source for strong fields. The weaker (stronger) the peak toroidal field is, the narrower (broader) is the bandwidth for which the toroidal field becomes the primary energy source. The Reynolds, Maxwell, and mixed stresses required to extract energy from the differential rotation and toroidal field are most active in the neighborhood of the singular or turning points of the perturbation equations. This first study focuses on toroidal fields that peak near 45° latitude, as in GF; later papers will place the toroidal-field peak at a wide variety of latitudes, as we might expect to occur at different phases of a sunspot cycle.}

	abstract = {Assuming that concentrated toroidal field bands occur in the solar tachocline at different latitudes as the solar cycle progresses, we examine the joint instability of latitudinal differential rotation and coexisting narrow bands placed at a wide range of latitudes. Following the basic formalism developed by Gilman & Fox and employing the numerical technique of Dikpati & Gilman, we show that the instability exists for almost all phases of the solar cycle, i.e., for a wide range of latitudinal positions of the bands of field strengths between 500 G and 200 kG. Modes with longitudinal wavenumber m = 1 up to m = 7, depending on parameter values, are unstable for both kinds of symmetries. Mid-latitude bands are the most unstable; the instability disappears if the band is at very high or low latitudes. High-latitude bands are highly unstable, with e-folding growth times of a few months, even when the field strength is low (about a few hundred gauss); low-latitude bands are unstable with longer growth times (\UTF{2265}1 yr), but for high field strengths (104-2 × 105 G). We argue that, because of the instability, the high-latitude bands would undergo turbulent mixing in the latitudinal direction on a timescale that is short compared to their build-up time from shearing of poloidal field by the differential rotation, and thus they may not be buoyant enough to appear as active regions at the surface, but the low-latitude bands can build up simultaneously with this instability and can eventually manifest as active regions. Instability for modes with m \UTF{2265} 1 could help determine the longitude distribution of active regions; nonlinear changes in the toroidal field due to the instability may contribute to their decay.}

	abstract = {Building on Cally's nonlinear model of two-dimensional MHD tachocline instability, we further explore the evolution of a wide variety of toroidal field profiles due to this instability. Cally showed in a recent study that an initially broad toroidal field opens up into a "clamshell" pattern because of nonlinear evolution of MHD tachocline instability. Various other toroidal field profiles—single toroidal bands, double bands, and mixed profiles with a band in addition to broad profiles—may also occur in the Sun during various phases of the solar cycle. Detailed study of the evolution of banded profiles shows no occurrence of clamshell instability, but the bands commonly tip relative to the axis of rotation. The higher the latitude location of the band, the more it tips. Extreme tipping results when the band is at 60° latitude or higher—the magnetic ring hangs from the pole on one side of the Sun. For bands of 10° latitude width at sunspot latitudes (\UTF{2264}40°), the band tip is within ±10° about the mean latitude of the band. This tipping could either enhance or reduce the observed tilt in bipolar active regions. Double bands, or profiles consisting of a band and a broad profile, may exist at certain phases of the solar cycle. We find that double-band systems with two oppositely directed bands separated widely (>15°) in latitude, as well as two close bands of same polarities, do not interact in the same hemisphere—the higher latitude band tips, while the lower latitude band hardly responds. A significant interaction between two individual bands in one hemisphere takes place only when the band separation is \UTF{2264}15° and the bands are oppositely directed, which is a nonsolar case. In this case, the band system either tips or forms the clamshell pattern depending on the dominant mode symmetry. We also show that a mixed profile with oppositely directed narrow fields close to the equator in addition to the broad fields evolve in such a way as to oppose the reconnection of the broad fields across the equator, and thus inhibiting the clamshell formation, at least at certain phases of the solar cycle. Finally, we note that the tipping and clamshell instabilities strongly inhibit differential rotation.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We develop a more realistic two-dimensional model for global MHD instabilities in the solar tachocline, by including diffusion in the form of kinetic and magnetic drag (following Newton's cooling law formulation). This instability has previously been studied by us and others for an idealized tachocline with no kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity. Since radial diffusion is more important than latitudinal diffusion in the thin solar tachocline, diffusive decay of flow and magnetic fields can be considered as proportional to those variables. We find that, for solar-like toroidal magnetic fields of ~100 kG, instability exists for a wide range of kinetic and magnetic drag parameters, providing a mechanism for enhanced angular momentum transport in latitudes, which could explain how thin the solar tachocline is. From a detailed parameter space survey, we set upper limits of 5 × 1011 and 3 × 1010 cm2 s-1 for kinematic viscosity and magnetic diffusivity, respectively, such that this instability occurs in the solar tachocline on a timescale shorter than a sunspot cycle. We find that magnetic drag has much more influence than kinetic drag in damping this instability. This happens because the sink due to magnetic drag dissipates perturbation magnetic energy faster than the vorticity sink from kinetic drag dissipates perturbation kinetic energy. Consequently, in the presence of a large enough magnetic drag, the nonsolar-like clamshell pattern, found by Cally to be an inevitable final state of a broad profile undergoing an ideal MHD tachocline instability, is suppressed, whereas a banded profile still tips with no reduction in tip angle. We discuss how tipping may affect various surface manifestations of magnetic features, such as the latitudes and orientations of bipolar active regions.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We examine the global MHD instability of solar tachocline latitudinal differential rotation and the coexisting broad toroidal magnetic field, using a "shallow-water" model that captures the simplest effects of subadiabatic stratification. We assume a single fluid shell that has a fixed bottom but variable thickness. This model is the MHD generalization of a hydrodynamic model that we have previously applied to the tachocline, although the solution method is somewhat different. Stratification in the model is characterized by an "effective gravity" G (G = 0 for adiabatic stratification). The radiative (lower) part of the tachocline thus has high G (~102) and the overshoot part, low G (less than 1). We obtain growth rates, phase velocities, and spatial structures of unstable modes for a wide range of toroidal field strengths and effective gravities, as well as differential rotations that are consistent with helioseismic observations. We recover known two-dimensional MHD stability results in the limit of large G and hydrodynamic instability results in the limit of vanishing toroidal field. For strong magnetic fields, only longitudinal wavenumber m = 1 is unstable, but for weak fields m = 2 is also. For peak toroidal fields of 20 kG and above, the growth rates and disturbance structures are essentially independent of the effective gravity, until it becomes so small that the fluid shell shrinks to zero in low latitudes, whereupon the instability is cut off. In contrast, the instability evolves radically at low G when toroidal field is increased from zero. In both overshoot and radiative parts of the tachocline, unstable modes grow fastest for toroidal fields of the order of 102 kG. The structure of the unstable disturbances is always governed by the latitude location of singular or critical points at which the Doppler-shifted phase velocity of the disturbance equals the local (angular) Alfv\UTF{00E9}n speed. All unstable disturbances possess kinetic helicity, narrowly concentrated in the neighborhood of the same critical points. Just as shown by Dikpati & Gilman for the hydrodynamic case, such disturbances could provide an "α-effect" for the solar dynamo. But unlike the hydrodynamic case, this α-effect would be a function of the toroidal field itself.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Recently global, quasi-two-dimensional instabilities of tachocline latitudinal differential rotation have been studied using a so-called shallow-water model. While purely hydrodynamic shallow-water type disturbances were found to destabilize only the overshoot tachocline, the MHD analysis showed that in the presence of a broad toroidal field, both the radiative and overshoot parts of the tachocline can be unstable. We explore here instability in the shallow-water solar tachocline with concentrated toroidal bands placed at a wide range of latitudes, emulating different phases of the solar cycle. In equilibrium, the poleward magnetic curvature stress of the band is balanced either by an equatorward hydrostatic pressure gradient or by the Coriolis force from a prograde jet inside the band. We find that toroidal bands placed almost at all latitudes make the system unstable to shallow-water disturbances. For bands without prograde jets, the instability persists well above 100 kG peak field, while a jet stabilizes the band at a field of ~40 kG. The jet imparts gyroscopic inertia to the toroidal band inhibiting it from unstably "tipping" its axis away from rotation axis. Like previously studied HD and MHD shallow-water instabilities in the tachocline, unstable shallow-water modes found here produce kinetic helicity and hence a tachocline α-effect; these narrow kinetic helicity profiles should generate narrowly confined poloidal fields, which will help formation of the narrow toroidal field. Toroidal bands poleward of 15° latitude suppress midlatitude hydrodynamic α-effects. However, even strong toroidal bands equatorward of 15° allow this hydrodynamic α-effect. Such bands should occur during the late declining phase of a solar cycle and, thus, could help the onset of a new cycle by switching on the mid latitude α-effect.}

    abstract = "{The solar tachocline straddles the base of the convection zone. In the radiative part, global scale latitudinal magneto-shear instabilities have been thought to be constrained to two dimensions by strongly stable stratification, and so two-dimensional (2D) instabilities have been examined in great detail recently. However, it is shown here that three-dimensional (3D) effects can be important. We generalize the linear 2D analysis to 3D in the Boussinesq thin layer approximation for models where the magnetic field is wrapped toroidally around the Sun, and the equilibrium field and flow are independent of depth. It is found that a very rapid ‘polar kink instability’ dominates the dynamics of broad magnetic field distributions if the polar Alfv\UTF{00E9}n angular speed αp exceeds the rotational angular velocity ωp, with maximum growth rate (αp2−ω2p)1/2. This might typically produce an e-folding time as short as a few months. Interestingly, the instability only affects the m = 1‘tipping modes’, twisting polar loops towards a vertical orientation. On the other hand, for αp2 \\&lt; ω2p, 3D instabilities are restricted to radial length scales in which perhaps just a few wavelengths could fit across the tachocline. These could supplement, or even dominate, the shallow-water modes examined recently by Gilman and Dikpati. An analysis of the role of a large Brunt—V\UTF{00E4}is\UTF{00E4}l\UTF{00E4} frequency, as found in the radiative part of the tachocline, suggests that its main effect is to flatten the motions in the instabilities rather than to suppress them. Strong banded magnetic profiles are found to be susceptible to an instability similar to but distinct from the polar kink.}",

For radiative tachocline stratification, the instability for both banded and broad toroidal field profiles is similar to the two-dimensional and shallow water cases studied previously, even though the unstable modes have substantial vertical structure. For overshoot tachocline stratification, instability for banded toroidal fields with peaks \UTF{2272}20 kG is similar to the corresponding shallow water case, but for substantially higher (perhaps unrealistic) toroidal fields there is no low-subadiabaticity cutoff, and modes appear with much higher growth rate and increasingly negative phase velocities in longitude, analogous to those found earlier by Cally. All of these results are only modestly sensitive to the tachocline thickness chosen. For broad toroidal field profiles, the instability results are similar to the two-dimensional and shallow water cases for toroidal field peaks up to at least 80 kG, unless the shell has a thickness that is a substantial fraction of a pressure scale height. For thinner shells, only above about 94 kG do the high growth rate, low phase velocity modes appear, with structure similar to the "polar kink" instability Cally found. But even in this case, we find that the slower growing "clam-shell" instability eventually replaces the faster growing polar kink modes. We conclude that for conditions most likely to occur in the solar tachocline, such as peak toroidal fields limited by the dynamo to 20 kG or less, the two-dimensional and shallow water type unstable modes are likely to predominate even when the tachocline has finite thickness and the modes can have radial structure.}

The work is motivated by suggestions that there is a stably stratified layer below the Earth’s core mantle boundary, and the existence of stable layers in stellar tachoclines. With an azimuthal background field known as the Malkus field, B\UTF{03D5}=B0sinθ, θ being the co-latitude, a non-diffusive instability is found with azimuthal wavenumber m=1. A necessary condition for instability is that the Alfv\UTF{00E9}n speed exceeds Ω0R0 where Ω0 is the rotation rate and R0 the sphere radius. Magneto-inertial gravity waves propagating westward and eastward occur, and become equatorially trapped when the field is strong. Magneto-Kelvin waves propagate eastward at low field strength, but a new westward propagating Kelvin wave is found when the field is strong. Fast magnetic Rossby waves travel westward, whilst the slow magnetic Rossby waves generally travel eastward, except for some m=1 modes at large field strength. An exceptional very slow westward m=1 magnetic Rossby wave mode occurs at all field strengths. The current-driven instability occurs for m=1 when the slow and fast magnetic Rossby waves interact. With strong field the magnetic Rossby waves become trapped at the pole. An asymptotic analysis giving the wave speed and wave form in terms of elementary functions is possible both in polar trapped and equatorially trapped cases. }

Across a broad range of conditions, we find that the key governing equation for atmospheres and quantum harmonic oscillators are identical, even when forcing (stellar irradiation), sources of friction (molecular viscosity, Rayleigh drag, and magnetic drag), and magnetic tension are included. The global atmospheric structure is largely controlled by a single key parameter that involves the Rossby and Prandtl numbers. This near-universality breaks down when either molecular viscosity or magnetic drag acts non-uniformly across latitude or a poloidal magnetic field is present, suggesting that these effects will introduce qualitative changes to the familiar chevron-shaped feature witnessed in simulations of atmospheric circulation. We also find that hydrodynamic and magnetic sources of friction have dissimilar phase signatures and affect the flow in fundamentally different ways, implying that using Rayleigh drag to mimic magnetic drag is inaccurate. We exhaustively lay down the theoretical formalism (dispersion relations, governing equations, and time-dependent wave solutions) for a broad suite of models. In all situations, we derive the steady state of an atmosphere, which is relevant to interpreting infrared phase and eclipse maps of exoplanetary atmospheres. We elucidate a pinching effect that confines the atmospheric structure to be near the equator. Our suite of analytical models may be used to develop decisively physical intuition and as a reference point for three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of atmospheric circulation.}

Concomitant magnetic variations due to inertial modes in the core would, owing to their relatively short periods (several days), fail to penetrate to the surface of the Earth, although the eddy currents induced in the lower mantle by these modes might affect the mechanical coupling between the mantle and the core. }

    abstract = { Abstract The onset of instability for a self-gravitating, internally heated, fluid sphere of radius, r\UTF{2217}0, at large Taylor number, [Ttilde] (a measure of the rotation rate), is investigated. The pioneering work of Roberts (1968) and Busse (1970) has shown that at the onset of instability convection is concentrated in a layer of thickness, r\UTF{2217}0[Ttilde]−1/9, which forms a cylindrical surface, coaxial with the diameter parallel to the angular velocity. Inside this layer, Rossby waves of short length scale, r\UTF{2217}0 [Ttilde]− 1/6, propagate eastwards. For Rayleigh numbers, [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}, close to the critical value, [Rtilde]\UTF{2217} c , determined by Busse (1970), a linear equation governing the evolution of the waves on the long length scale, r\UTF{2217}0[Ttilde]−1/9, and a long lime scale is derived., When [Rtilde]\UTF{2217} is greater than [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}c some disturbances applied at time t\UTF{2217} = 0 initially grow exponentially. Nevertheless the equation has the remarkable property that, as t\UTF{2217} → ∞, all solutions decay exponentially irrespective of the value of [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}. Therefore, since no steady or periodic solution is possible, the critical Rayleigh number in the accepted sense is not close to [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}c. When ([Rtilde]\UTF{2217}—[Rtilde]\UTF{2217}c )/[Rtilde]\UTF{2217} c is of order [Ttilde]−1/9, conditions are favourable for convection in a layer of thickness, r\UTF{2217}0[Ttilde]− 1/18. Here the paradoxical behaviour of the linear solutions is resolved by finite amplitude effects, which take account of modifications to the mean state caused by heat and angular momentum transport. Within the [Ttilde]−1/18-convection layer, the non-linear equations admit solutions in which convection is concentrated on the smaller r\UTF{2217}0[Ttilde]− 1/9 -length scale. These localised disturbances, in general drift with speed, c\UTF{2217}s , which varies slowly as the disturbance (a thermally driven solitary wave) moves across the convection layer. When [Rtilde]\UTF{2217} is less than a certain value, [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}stat (say), all solitary waves move inwards towards the rotation axis. On the other hand, when [Rtilde]\UTF{2217} exceeds [Rtilde]\UTF{2217}stat, some solitary waves move outwards away from the rotation axis in certain regions of the convection layer. In practice [Ttilde]− 1/18 is not particularly small so that the fine details of the solitary wave evolution are unimportant. Nevertheless, the general features of solitary wave structures is significant. }

However, the presence of these waves in the Sun is still debated. Here, we unambiguously discover and characterize retrograde-propagating vorticity waves in the shallow subsurface layers of the Sun at azimuthal wavenumbers below 15, with the dispersion relation of textbook sectoral Rossby waves. The waves have lifetimes of several months, well-defined mode frequencies below twice the solar rotational frequency, and eigenfunctions of vorticity that peak at the equator. Rossby waves have nearly as much vorticity as the convection at the same scales, thus they are an essential component of solar dynamics. We observe a transition from turbulence-like to wave-like dynamics around the Rhines scale6 of angular wavenumber of approximately 20. This transition might provide an explanation for the puzzling deficit of kinetic energy at the largest spatial scales.},

	abstract = "Synopsis
Existing theories of stationary plasma oscillations lead to a dispersion equation (2), involving an integration across a pole. It is here shown that this difficulty is of purely mathematical origin, and can be overcome by a proper treatment. This treatment leads to a complete set of stationary solutions, which are much more numerous than the usual plasma oscillations. In particular, their wave lengths and frequencies are not connected by a dispersion equation, but independently assume all real values. Special superpositions of these stationary solutions correspond to the usual plasma oscillations. They constitute slightly damped plane waves, which do obey the dispersion equation (2), the integral being interpreted as a Cauchy principal value. An arbitrary initial distribution behaves (after a short transient time) like a superposition of such waves, as far as the density is concerned."
